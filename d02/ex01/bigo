Where n is the number of elements in the array:

Performance:
	Worst case - O(n^2) comparisons and swaps
	Best case  - O(n) comparisons, O(1) swaps
	Avg case   - O(n^2) comparisons and swaps

Space complexity:
	Worst case - O(n) total, and O(1) auxiliary

(auxiliary space is the temporary space used by the algorithm)
