O(n+m) best case time complexity,
       where 'n' is length of search string and 'm' is the combined length of the pattern strings

O(nm) worst case time complexity,
      where 'n' is length of search string and 'm' is the combined length of the pattern strings

O(p) space complexity,
     where 'p' is the number of pattern strings
